# <pre-bootcamp-project>

## Description

The projects start was to my best understanding to create a github account and become familiar with its uses and with command line controls. The proejct was done for accademic purposes to learn about github and gain a base understanding of some of the features so the class would not slow down as we tried to pick it up later for the first time. The github solves my problem of sharing and working on group projects. I learned about the parts of HTML, what CSS is, how to use github and how to use VS. I had some knowledge of Javascript previously so nothing covered here was new on that front. 

## Installation

First pull down the main origin from the git hub repository which is open to public. Then open it up in VS using the code . command. then go to run and select browser you wish to run the project in.

## Usage

This projects purpose is to create a basic HTML page with some CSS and javascript elements. It is mainly here to teach the basics of GitHub  and console commands.

## Tests

placing this in your html file could allow you to test the javascript logic. 

 <h3>Create Input Box</h3>
    <input type="text" id="Topic" placeholder="Enter Topic">
    <button id="btn">Save</button>
    <script src="code.js"></script>

The code provided should provide an input box for someone to then enter an input into. Then you would have to edit the javascript code to handle the input accordingly.
